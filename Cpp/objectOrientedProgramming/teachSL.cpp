// enum
// const, mutable, explicit
// only const functions can be used if datas are declared const.
// how datas are still mutable despite an object being called const in main/other functions.

// public, priv, protected members
// public, priv, protected data
// public, priv, protected functions
// (using functions, scope operators:: and .(dot operator)
    // how using objB.protdataA works in class B but not in main/other functions.
// how a priv, protected, public function/ data can be accessible through aggregation. (using . operator)
// how a priv, protected, public function/ data can be accessible through inheritance. (using :: operator)

// pure virtual functions (for abstract class)
// Virtual functions ( to determine if pointer class or object class gets called) => polymorphism
// Virtual destructors declared at different hierarchies.

// Friend functions.
// All member of a class can be made into a friend function.

// Static functions

// Overloading Assignment Operator & Overloading Copy Constructor. When is one called and the other..

// keyword this
// return by reference using keyword this is safer.

// dynamic_cast for polymorphism
