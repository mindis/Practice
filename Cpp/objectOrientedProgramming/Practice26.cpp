//
// This program studies classes, inheritance , and friend functions fully
// How public, protected, private data differs..

// implemented on variables, member functions, and what is its scope to children and main
// when derived class is public parent, protected parent, private parent,
// what exactly gets passed down? what exactly is accessible,
// how does scope resolution :: and dot . operator changes the accessibility of data?

// note:This file is gonna be very long and detailed!!
// note: after done, make a file comparing structs and classes -- struct objects with no member function, parent and child class.
